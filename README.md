# Kafka & YOLOv8 Real-Time Face Recognition

This project integrates **Apache Kafka** with **YOLOv8** to enable real-time streaming and face recognition across multiple video feeds.

## Features

- **Real-Time Video Ingestion**: Streams video frames from multiple sources using Kafka, ensuring efficient data transfer and processing.
- **Face Detection and Recognition**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for high-accuracy face detection and recognition within the video streams, providing immediate identification and tracking.
- **Multiprocessing**: Leverages multiprocessing to handle multiple video feeds and processing tasks concurrently, improving overall system performance.
